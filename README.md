# SmartSwitch
Particle (Spark) Core based "smart switch"

Code can be compiled and uploaded to device using the Particle Build page (https://build.particle.io/build/). Since Particle Build does not yet support Git integration you will need to copy-and-paste code if any updates are made.

## Hardware
Components used:
* Particle Core (www.particle.io)
* Relay module (ebay)
* DHT22 module (ebay)
